# Responsive Portfolio

This is the second exercise in week two of the @[ThisIsMetis](https://github.com/thisismetis) [UX &amp; Front-End Development](http://www.tis.com/ux-front-end-development) Fall 2014 BootCamp.

For this exercise, we are given a fully designed portfolio website which we must make responsive with the following requirements:

* Convert width-based elements in the layout to a percentage-based, fluid grid.
  * Include margin and padding on block elements.
  * Match proportions of original layout exactly.
* Use media-queries to target two breakpoints:
  * At viewports 800px and smaller, headings, contact info, about blurb, and skill list should collapse into one column.
  * At viewports 500px and smaller, the images should collapse into one column.
